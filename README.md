### BLOCKCHAIN - PYTHON - NEO4J 
Goal is to create a blockchain in Golang then generate transactions on a local network to ultimately study patterns using Python and Neo4j 

##### First Stage - Blockchain 
Create Blockchain from scratch with a simple PoW mechanism which can then be improved on slowly.


##### Second Stage - Python 
Mainly data processing, pull the blockchain into python and flatten to get a dataframe that will ultimately trace everything back to the genesis block hopefully 

### Third Stage - Neo4j 

Import blockchain data via python and build a graph then the fun begins
